If we are building a real blog we might have the list of blogs in various places on our website it might be the homepage, search, category or tag page. So several different areas may use the same logic where we cycling/iterating through blogs and outputting a blog preview for each one. To implement that in our project we'll be repeating the code (map function iteration) over and over again in different components for different pages. Where we have pieces of components or bits of templates that might be reused in different positions or different places in the website we like to make that bit of template into its own reusable component. e.g. if we make a component blog list then we could drop this blog list component in any other components in the project. So if we have category page later on we could just get the blog list component and drop it in
