Project Structure: The Create React App tool generates a basic project structure for you. The most important files and directories are:
src/: This directory contains the source code for your React application.
src/index.js: This is the entry point of your React application.
src/App.js: This is the root component of your application.
public/: This directory contains the static assets, such as the HTML file (index.html) that serves as the entry point for your application.


The files in public directory are public (available in the browser) to the browser, our react code is rendered into the root element div.

index.js file takes all our react components and mounts them in the DOM. App component is rendered in index.html file in root element (gets injected in root div). 

reportWebVitals.js - performance file, App.test.js - testing file

React.StrictMode - Lets you find common bugs in your components early during development, shows warnings in the console.

All of our project dependencies live in 

package.json - 
start: start our server.
build: build our app for production.
test: test app.
eject: eject our webpack file.
