So now whenever we land on our home page, this fetch for data starts using using our custom hook (useFetch) and once it completes it tries to update the state in the home component and we see that effect right here because when the state changes we output that to the DOM that data however if while the data is still trying to be fetched while it's still loading we then go to another page before the fetch completes we get an error. So from homepage `/` we are going to new blog `/create` now the fetch is still happening on the background once we've switched to add a new blog '/create' and therefore when the fetch is complete it still tries to update that state in the `Home` component but the home component isn't in the browser any more (cause we're in the `/create' route that renders `Create` component) that's why we get this error because it's saying we can't perform a react state update on an unmounted (not in the browser currently) component. The unmounted component is the `Home` component. So we need a way of stopping the fetch when the component using it unmounts. So if we go home then quickly to new blog we want to stop that fetch from carrying on now to do this we'll be using a combination of the cleanup function in a useEffect hook and something called an abort controller in javascript. So first of all we're going to do is go to the useFetch hook that we have right here
