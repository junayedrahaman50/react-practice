Lesson 32 (404 pages and next steps):

So final thing to do in this project is to create some kind of 404 component or a not found component that we wanna show when a user tries to go to some kind of url that doesn't exist cause currently there is no route setup for that particular url and it isn't showing any content. So let's create a component for this inside source folder we will create a file that is Notfound.js.

Notfound.js
-----------
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

/* lesson 32: we'll create a stateless functional component sfc.  This will have a div with class `not-found`. It is going to have an `h2`,`p` tag, and a Link to send the user back to the homepage. To import the Link component write link by starting with `<` sign. So this is out `Notfound` component all we wanna do now is set it up so anyone tries to go to the route that doesn't exist we show that component and the way to do that is by going to App component and adding in kind of a catch all route(again it's like express.js) for this. So we need to this down here at the bottom in App.js file that is `App` component.*/
const Notfound = () => {
  return (
    <div className="not-found">
      <h2>Sorry</h2>
      <p>That page can not be found.</p>
      <Link to="/">Go back to the homepage...</Link>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Notfound;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
App.js
------
import Navbar from "./Navbar";
import Home from "./Home";

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
// import create component
import Create from "./Create";
import BlogDetails from "./BlogDetails";
import Notfound from "./Notfound";

function App() {
  // const title = "Welcome to the new blog!";

  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="App">
        <Navbar />
        <div className="content">
          {/* <Home /> */}
          <Switch>
            <Route exact path="/">
              <Home />
            </Route>
            <Route path="/create">
              <Create />
            </Route>
            <Route path="/blogs/:id">
              <BlogDetails />
            </Route>
            {/* lesson 32: the Notfound component will be rendered here in a catch all route, so we're gonna add another route. Again start writing `Notfound` from `<` sign as it will help autoimport it in the top and now we want the path in this route to be asterix `*`, that means look catch any other route, now this goes at the bottom because otherwise it's gonna match that comes in if it goes at the top. If it goes at the bottom if none of the routes defined above it match then this `*` one matches regardless it's kind of like a catch-all route. So if we save it now, upon entering route in the address bar that doesn't exist in the browser we'll see the `Notfound` component being rendered. So with this this project is pretty much complete nowðŸ”¥. */}
            <Route path="*">
              <Notfound />
            </Route>
          </Switch>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}
/* lesson 32(Conclusion): To further advance in react we can check out the react docs or advanced react tutorials. learn useRef, useMemo, useReducer, and useCallback hook. Also edit functionality in this blog can be implemented by making a fetch request (send the id as prop from `BlogDetails` component to some `Edit` component and implement the fetch function PUT request there this solution is an experiment) */

export default App;
